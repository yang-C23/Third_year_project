She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient 's urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .

After 1 day of chemotherapy , the patient had 8-10 RBC 's in her urine but by the second day of her IFEX infusion , she had 50-80 RBC 's in her urine as well as a few transitional epithelial cells .
