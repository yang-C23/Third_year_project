She was called at 430 am today from the NH with the news that the pt was not doing well , and she came to the Deanna to meet up with her father .
Of note , the patient 's daughter and son-in-law confirm his desire to be DNR/DNI , stating that they want him to be comfortable .
However , when asked if she thinks he would want comfort measures even if it meant that his respiratory status would worsen , the pt 's daughter says that he would not .

Brief Hospital Course :
This 86 yo man with h/o CVA , CHF , recent episodes of aspiration pneumonia , presented with dyspnea from his NH , likely from new RLL pneumonia .
He was started on Zosyn and Vanco for his presumed aspiration , ' hospital ' aquired PNA .
PE was considered but less likely given his fevers and clear pneumonia on CXR .
He was supported on BIPAP for his respiratory status .
An ABG was attempted in the Deanna however it was limited by pt discomfort .
ABG on arrival to the ICU was 7.29/56/75 .
He was continued on BIPAP .
Blood cultures and sputum cultures were sent .
Over the course of the day he continued to decline .
He was given some prn Morphine for comfort .
In the evening of the day of admission he was noted to be increasingly somnolent .
A repeat ABG was performed which was 7.03/129/148 .
His family was notified that he was doing worse and came in to visit him .
It was his family 's wish that he be made comfortable .
Based upon this wish the BIPAP was removed and he was placed on nasal cannula .
He was written for a morphine drip however he expired before this could be initiated .

DM2 :
He was covered with a Insulin drip while unstable
CV :
