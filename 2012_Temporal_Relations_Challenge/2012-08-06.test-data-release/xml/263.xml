HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 82 - year-old male with a history of hypertension , remote tobacco abuse , chronic renal insufficiency , and a history of a TIA who was in his usual state of health until five nights prior to admission when he awoke at midnight with severe epigastric pain radiating to both arms .
He also had bilateral arm numbness .
The symptoms were associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath but no nausea or vomiting .
After approximately one hour , he presented to the Bristol County Tuberculosis Hospital Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Campus where he ruled in for a non-ST elevation MI with a CK of 438 with a peak CK MB of 19.8 and troponin that peaked at 10.2 .
He was started on nitrates there as well as heparin and Integrelin and remained pain-free .
He denied any history of similar symptoms in the past and has had no prior history of angina or myocardial infarction .
The patient was subsequently transferred to Youville Hospital for cardiac catheterization .
At the time of transfer , he was initially admitted to the CMI Service after undergoing cardiac catheterization which revealed a long LAD lesion that was angioplastied without stent placement , and a total occlusion of the RCA with collaterals .
He subsequently became hypotensive and bradycardiac in the Catheterization Laboratory which responded to IV fluids , dopamine , Atropine , and he was then transferred to the CCU for further monitoring .
He had a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram done in the Cardiac Catheterization laboratory without evidence of an effusion .
A Swan was also placed .
There were no stents deployed at all throughout the catheterization .
By the time he was admitted , he was off pressors and hemodynamically stable and pain-free .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CARDIOVASCULAR :
As summarized above , the patient had a non-ST elevation MI with evidence of an 80 percent mid LAD lesion for which he underwent angioplasty without stent placement .
He was initially continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta blocker , statin , and ACE inhibitor .
At the time of discharge , his Plavix was held due to Guaiac positive stools and hematocrit drop throughout admission .
He had a transthoracic echocardiogram the day after admission showing an ejection fraction of greater than 60 percent .
No focal wall motion abnormalities .
He had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath throughout admission .
In regards to his rhythm , he has an underlying right bundle branch block and first-degree AV block which were stable throughout this admission .
He will be followed-up by his cardiologist after discharge .
1. PULMONARY :
He had a history of COPD for which he is on baseline 2 liters of 02 by nasal cannula at home and Albuterol and Atrovent MDI s p.r.n. at home .
He is also on Flovent MDI at home as well .
He was continued on his MDI and was at his baseline 02 requirement throughout admission .
1. RENAL :
He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency likely secondary to hypertension and was admitted with a creatinine of 1.6 .
His ACE inhibitor post MI was initially held due to his creatinine .
However , this responded to IV fluids and his ACE inhibitor was restarted at the time of discharge .
He will need close monitoring of his creatinine post discharge in the setting of reinstitution of his ACE inhibitor .
1. GASTROINTESTINAL :
His stools were noted to be Guaiac positive at the outside hospital and there was still concern for possible GI bleed given continued Guaiac positive stools during this admission and a slight drop in his hematocrit from 39 to 33 .
It was felt most appropriate for him to have an outpatient GI workup , and his PCP was contacted and will arrange for outpatient colonoscopy .
His Plavix was held at the time of discharge due to a question of GI bleed and in the setting of not having a stent placed at the time of catheterization .
He was continued on his aspirin , however .
