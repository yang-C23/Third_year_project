HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Wisniewski is a 45-year-old woman with multiple familial cavernous hemangiomas .
She is right-handed .
She was in her usual state of health until one and a half weeks prior to admission .
She developed an ear ache , for which she saw her primary care physician , Evelyn was prescribed cortisone drops .
A few days later she complained of dizziness .
This was mostly described as feeling unsteady on her feet .
She stated that she had trouble knowing if her feet were touching the ground .
She was seen again by primary care physician , Roderick since she had complaints of dizziness , as well as a new complaint of decreased hearing and the sensation of static in her ears , meniere 's disease was considered .
She was given an oral prednisone taper .
This unsteady gait progressed , and then she subsequently started to develop a pins and needle feeling in the face , hands and feet bilaterally .
Her hearing got progressively worse and the sound of static increased .
She was very fatigued .
At an outside hospital , head CT revealed a 1.5 cm diameter hyperdense mass in the pons , slightly off center to the right .
She was transferred here for further care .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mrs. Wisniewski is a 45 - year-old woman with a strong family history of cavernous angiomas .
She has had several prior bleeding events and presented with a subacute bleed in the mid to lower pons .
There was relatively central in location , with only a slight right-sided predominance .
Her physical examination remained relatively unchanged , with resolution of the subtle left hand weakness and right facial weakness .
Her gait remained severely ataxic , likely secondary to sensory deafferentation , as well as involvement of crossing pontine cerebellar fibers .
Therefore , it was recommended that she have aggressive Physical Therapy at an Acute Rehabilitation Center .
The case was discussed with Dr. Harold from the Falmouth Hospital .
He has followed this family in the past and will see her in follow-up .
We will arrange to have a copy of the MRI scans sent to him .
