Admission Date :
11/09/2003
Discharge Date :
11/16/2003
SERVICE :
GMS 1 Medical Service .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. GI :
Patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission .
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C .
His Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the Coumadin .
He was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following :
In the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous .
A small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an Endoclip was applied to this .
Another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .
In the duodenum , a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized .
The biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia .
Also of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .
Patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge .
His last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 .
His last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 .
Consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy .
This was discussed with the GI Service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in 05/2003 .
2. Cardiovascular :
A :
Ischemia :
Patient &apos;s troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his GI bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome .
On discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his Lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted .
B :
Rhythm :
Patient continued to be in A-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his Coumadin concurrently with heparin .
Heparin was subsequently DCd once his INR reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 .
His last reported INR on discharge was 2.5 .
C :
Valves :
Patient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .
However , his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge .
D :
Pump :
Patient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .
He was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix .
He subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .
Of note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission .
