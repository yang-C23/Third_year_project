Admission Date :

Discharge Date :

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .
She was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .
The patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .
A mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .
However , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .
Fine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .
Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .
Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .
Dr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .
The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .
The margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .
Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .
The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .
Estrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .
The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .
Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .
Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
The patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .
There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .
However , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .
ABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .
Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .
The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .
Basically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .
Although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .
She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .
Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .
She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .
It was treated with gent and Cipro .
Re-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .
In May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .
In mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .
The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .
She has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .
We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .
